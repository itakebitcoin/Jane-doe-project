# Jane Doe Search System

**Created by:** [@itakebitcoin](https://github.com/itakebitcoin)  
**Repository:** [Jane-Doe-Project](https://github.com/itakebitcoin/Jane-Doe-Project)

A Python-based system for searching Jane Doe databases to help reunite families with missing loved ones. This tool provides both command-line and (planned) graphical interfaces for searching unidentified persons databases using physical characteristics and location filters.

## üéØ Purpose

This system is designed to help families find missing loved ones by searching publicly available Jane Doe databases. It uses advanced matching algorithms to compare physical characteristics and location data across multiple databases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This tool is intended for ethical use only.** Please use it responsibly to help reunite families with missing loved ones. Always work with law enforcement for verification of any potential matches.

## üåü Features

- **Multi-Database Search**: Searches NamUs, DoeNetwork, and other public databases
- **Physical Characteristics Matching**: Height, weight, race, sex, age, distinguishing marks
- **Location Filtering**: State, county, city-based searches
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Advanced algorithms for approximate matches
- **Confidence Scoring**: Results ranked by match probability
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Command-line interface (GUI planned)
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Built-in reminders for responsible usage

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection for database access
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itakebitcoin/Jane-Doe-Project
cd Jane-Doe-Project
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the system**
```bash
python main.py
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Command Line Interface

Start the interactive CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

The CLI provides these options:
1. **Set Physical Characteristics** - Enter height, weight, race, sex, age, distinguishing marks
2. **Set Location Filters** - Specify state, county, city
3. **Perform Search** - Search databases with current criteria
4. **Show Current Criteria** - Review your search parameters
5. **Clear Criteria** - Reset all search parameters
6. **Help & Instructions** - Detailed usage guide
7. **Ethics & Guidelines** - Important ethical usage information

### Example Search Process

1. Start the program: `python main.py`
2. Choose option 1 to set physical characteristics
3. Enter known details (height: 5'6", weight: 140 lbs, etc.)
4. Choose option 2 to set location (if known)
5. Choose option 3 to perform the search
6. Review results ranked by confidence score

## üìä Understanding Results

Results are displayed with:
- **Confidence Score**: Percentage indicating match likelihood
- **Case Information**: Database source, case ID, URL
- **Physical Details**: Height, weight, race, sex, age
- **Location**: Where remains were found
- **Match Reasons**: Why this case was considered a match

### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH (80%+)**: Strong potential match
- **MEDIUM (60-79%)**: Good potential match  
- **LOW (40-59%)**: Possible match worth investigating
- **VERY LOW (<40%)**: Weak match, review carefully

## üóÉÔ∏è Supported Databases

### Currently Implemented
- **NamUs** (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System)
- **DoeNetwork** (Volunteer-run database)

### Planned Additions
- Local coroner office databases
- State-specific databases
- International databases (future)

## üîß Configuration

### Search Sensitivity
You can adjust the minimum confidence threshold by modifying the `SearchEngine` settings in the code.

### Database Selection
Choose which databases to search through the CLI or by modifying the `SearchCriteria`.
